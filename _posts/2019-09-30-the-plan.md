description: A list of machine generated prompts for Inktober.
---

I've never considered participating in Inktober. I don't think of myself an artist, but then I saw [a fascinating set of machine generated drawing prompts on Janelle Shane's AI Weirdness blog](https://aiweirdness.com/post/187962817292/ainktober-a-neural-net-creates-drawing-prompts) and that convinced me to try.

This won't be polished, but I hope it will be delightfully strange in the spirit of machine generated ideas, and the spooky month of October.
