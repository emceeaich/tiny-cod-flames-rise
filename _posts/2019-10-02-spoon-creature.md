There are two kinds of people who love [Spoon's 2005 album *Gimme Fiction.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimme_Fiction) People like me who learned about the band from this album and bought all the band's back catalog. And people who heard this album, bought Spoon's back catalog and pretend they have loved them all along.

Since the first track on the album is 'The Beast and Dragon Adored,' I should have had the creature flirting with a dragon.
